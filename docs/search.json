    "text": "My research explores how artificial intelligence and digital technologies are transforming organizations, markets, and society. I focus on data-intensive, applied research that integrates theory building with real-world impact through collaborations with industry partners.\n\n\n\n\nI examine issues such as algorithmic bias, AI fairness, and human–AI collaboration in decision-making contexts. This stream of work includes collaborations with leading interviewing and selection platforms, exploring how machine learning models built on natural language and audio data can both encode and mitigate bias in organizational decision-making.\nKey questions: How can organizations leverage AI responsibly? What are the mechanisms through which language-based AI models may inadvertently reproduce demographic and linguistic biases? How can we develop methodological innovations to reduce such bias?\n\n\n\nI study how information systems and AI shape competition, transparency, and user behavior in online marketplaces. This body of work developed foundational insights into how information availability and search costs shape both buyer and seller behavior.\nKey questions: How do online platforms alter market efficiency? How do sellers strategically exploit information asymmetries? How do platform transparency policies affect user contributions?\n\n\n\nI investigate how digital tools and data enable entrepreneurial adaptation and ecosystem evolution. Building on my decade-long leadership of the Severino Center for Technological Entrepreneurship, I examine how entrepreneurs leverage digital tools to navigate uncertainty, pivot business models, and engage with innovation ecosystems.\nKey questions: How do government grants shape entrepreneurial ecosystems? How can large language models help measure startup pivots?

    "text": "I examine issues such as algorithmic bias, AI fairness, and human–AI collaboration in decision-making contexts. This stream of work includes collaborations with leading interviewing and selection platforms, exploring how machine learning models built on natural language and audio data can both encode and mitigate bias in organizational decision-making.\nKey questions: How can organizations leverage AI responsibly? What are the mechanisms through which language-based AI models may inadvertently reproduce demographic and linguistic biases? How can we develop methodological innovations to reduce such bias?\n\n\n\nI study how information systems and AI shape competition, transparency, and user behavior in online marketplaces. This body of work developed foundational insights into how information availability and search costs shape both buyer and seller behavior.\nKey questions: How do online platforms alter market efficiency? How do sellers strategically exploit information asymmetries? How do platform transparency policies affect user contributions?\n\n\n\nI investigate how digital tools and data enable entrepreneurial adaptation and ecosystem evolution. Building on my decade-long leadership of the Severino Center for Technological Entrepreneurship, I examine how entrepreneurs leverage digital tools to navigate uncertainty, pivot business models, and engage with innovation ecosystems.\nKey questions: How do government grants shape entrepreneurial ecosystems?
