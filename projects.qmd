## ChatMFG: Secure LLMs for Manufacturing

ChatMFG addresses a critical gap in AI adoption for manufacturers who recognize the transformative potential of large language models but cannot adopt cloud-based solutions due to data security and intellectual property concerns.

The platform enables manufacturers to deploy advanced LLM capabilities entirely within their own secure environments, featuring manufacturing-optimized models, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for proprietary documents, and human-in-the-loop fine-tuning.

Developed in collaboration with RPI's Center for Smart Convergent Manufacturing Systems (CSCMS) and industry partner Sono-Tek Corporation.
