My research explores how artificial intelligence and digital technologies are transforming organizations, markets, and society. I focus on data-intensive, applied research that integrates theory building with real-world impact through collaborations with industry partners.

## Research Areas

::: {.research-area}
### Applied Artificial Intelligence {#ai-fairness}

I examine issues such as algorithmic bias, AI fairness, and human--AI collaboration in decision-making contexts. This stream of work includes collaborations with leading interviewing and selection platforms, exploring how machine learning models built on natural language and audio data can both encode and mitigate bias in organizational decision-making.

**Key questions:** How can organizations leverage AI responsibly? What are the mechanisms through which language-based AI models may inadvertently reproduce demographic and linguistic biases? How can we develop methodological innovations to reduce such bias?

### Digital Platforms & Online Markets

I study how information systems and AI shape competition, transparency, and user behavior in online marketplaces. This body of work developed foundational insights into how information availability and search costs shape both buyer and seller behavior.

**Key questions:** How do online platforms alter market efficiency? How do sellers strategically exploit information asymmetries? How do platform transparency policies affect user contributions?

### Entrepreneurship & Innovation Ecosystems

I investigate how digital tools and data enable entrepreneurial adaptation and ecosystem evolution. Building on my decade-long leadership of the Severino Center for Technological Entrepreneurship, I examine how entrepreneurs leverage digital tools to navigate uncertainty, pivot business models, and engage with innovation ecosystems.

**Key questions:** How do government grants shape entrepreneurial ecosystems? How can large language models help measure startup pivots? How does social media affect venture financing?
