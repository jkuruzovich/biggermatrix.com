Over the past two decades at RPI, I've taught an unusually broad range of topics---database design, quantitative methods, internet marketing, entrepreneurship, applied machine learning, and applied projects. My teaching philosophy adapts to the type of course, but the central theme remains constant: fundamental shifts in the economics of data creation, storage, and use are transforming individuals, organizations, and markets.
